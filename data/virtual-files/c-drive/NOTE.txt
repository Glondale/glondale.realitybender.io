Additional Notes on This Computer
================================

If you're reading this, you've found some kind of old computer. Good find!

This appears to be running Windows 95, which is pretty retro. The previous owner left some interesting files around.

Try upgrading the operating system if you can - newer versions of Windows might give you access to more files and better tools.

There's something odd about the file timestamps though. Some of them seem to be in the future? That's probably just a clock error.

The email client has some strange messages too. Check those out.

Happy exploring!

P.S. - If you see any files that seem "too advanced" for this era, that's probably just the previous owner being creative with filenames. Nothing to worry about.
