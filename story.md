# Reality-Bending OS - Story Outline

## High-Level Story Premise

**Central Mystery**: The player has unknowingly acquired a quantum computer from the year 2225, disguised as an ordinary desktop. As they upgrade through different Windows versions, they gradually uncover the truth about temporal displacement, future civilization collapse, and their role in preventing—or causing—a catastrophic timeline loop.

**Core Theme**: The intersection of technology and humanity across time, exploring how our digital footprints define us and how the future might judge our present.

**Narrative Arc**: Discovery → Investigation → Revelation → Choice
