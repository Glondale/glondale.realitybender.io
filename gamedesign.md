## Modular Game Architecture

### Core System Design Philosophy
The game is built on a **modular, event-driven architecture** that allows for easy expansion without breaking existing functionality. Each component is designed to be:
- **Loosely Coupled**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- **Hot-Swappable**: New content can be added without touching core systems
- **Version Agnostic**: New OS versions can be added with minimal core changes
- **Backwards Compatible**: New features don't break existing save files

### Plugin Architecture
```javascript
// Core extension system
GameCore = {
  OS: {}, // Operating system implementations
  Apps: {}, // Application plugins
  Stories: {}, // Narrative modules
  Puzzles: {}, // Puzzle mechanics
  UI: {}, // Interface components
  FileSystem: {}, // Virtual file system
  Extensions: {} // Third-party expansions
}
```

### Content Management System
All game content is stored in **JSON configuration files** that can be modified without touching code:

```json
{
  "timeline": {
    "windows95": {
      "unlocks": ["basic_email", "simple_files", "notepad"],
      "restrictions": ["advanced_search", "cortana", "powershell_v2"],
      "story_triggers": ["first_boot", "discover_encryption", "find_diary"]
    }
  }
}
```
